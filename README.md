# Spring boot project based on spring-batch
_____
Main purpose of this project is to fetch data from some weather site and store in RDMBS (MySQL).   
After that sync and store in another data source - NoSQL DB (MongoDB).
This is alternative (and much simler) approach of another solution with Apache Spark that can be found [here](https://github.com/kgromov/spark-convertor).
